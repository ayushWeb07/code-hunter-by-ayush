    "description": "JavaScript is a popular programming language that is used to create interactive web pages and web applications. It is a client-side scripting language, which means it runs on the user's computer rather than on the server. JavaScript is known for its versatility and can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as validating user input, creating animations, and manipulating web page content. JavaScript is a great language for beginners to learn because it has a relatively simple syntax and is widely supported by modern web browsers.",
